# Beecher-Stowe-Child-Ext-Pubs
### Lets a User search and filter on a custom post type (Publications)
#### For use in `news.extension.uconn.edu`

**Note:** I'd really like to abstract this but time is of the essence for the Extension team.

## Overview
- Requires an ACF Post type of Publications
  - Requires an additional custom taxonomy of `publication_year`
- Requires a page named "search"
- Publications are then built in the same way Posts or Pages are
